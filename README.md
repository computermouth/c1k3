## C1K3

![title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/computermouth/c1k3-assets/master/gifs/title.gif)

C1K3 is a clone of [PhobosLab](https://phoboslab.org/)'s incredible [JS13K](https://js13kgames.com/) entry: [Q1K3](https://js13kgames.com/entries/q1k3). This version is written in C on top of SDL2 + GLES2.

While Q1K3 strives to fit inside a 13KB package, C1K3 does not. The binary weighs in at ~3MB, and links in quite a bit more in dependencies. Textures, models, and maps are included directly into the binary in their raw file formats where possible.
